# anomly_chip_detection_with_logistics_regression
The project is about building a logistic regression that predicts qualified chips. The project is taught by Flare Zhao in his course, "Python 3 Intro to Artificial Intelligence".

The project is similar to “predict_exam_pass_with_logistics_regression”. The data in this project is more complex which requires a polynomial decision boundary equation. To find the complete graph of the decision boundaries, a quadratic formula is applied to the decision equation. 

At first 2 discontinuous boundary lines were found due to the range of X data. The X value is then extended to have the complete picture of the graph.
